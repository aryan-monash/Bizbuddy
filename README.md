## Made with Shiny [(Demo)](https://aryan-jain.shinyapps.io/BizBuddy)

With the snowballing growth of globalization, local businesses find it quite challenging competing with global markets. One such area that has suffered significantly is retail. Small and medium scale business may not necessarily have the capital or motivation to hire a team of analyst. Nevertheless, they can still do some elementary analysis, customer segmentation and even predict the growth of their business.

Below is a basic preview of the app in action.

The focus of this project will be on analysing a retail store’s customer database to understand customer behaviour using metrics such as conversion rate and total amount spent in recent transactions.

- The app will also look into which categories of product are more prone to returns and which age groups are more likely to return.
- Trend analysis will be done to identify seasonality and overall growth.
- Finally, factors such as gender, age and location will be used as explanatory variables to analyse the effect on customer’s buying
decision.

The analysis done can be used for customer segmentation to provide exclusive offers to existing customers and build a model for customer retention.
